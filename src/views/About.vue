            <p class="text-justify">IncluCity was born out of the collective vision and determination of a group of fourth-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology students, specializing in Service Management. The project began in February 2024, with a mission to serve the Municipality of Malolos, Bulacan, and to bring meaningful change to the lives of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) through a web-based platform aimed at supporting the City Social Welfare and Development Office (CSWDO). This system wasn’t just a course requirement—it was a heartfelt commitment to create a better, more inclusive community for everyone.

            <div class="lg:flex gap-x-20">
                <p class="text-justify">The team, known as Technobytes, was formed in January 2024 under the leadership of Heart Angel Dela Cruz. With vision and determination, she guided the project forward. Allia Grace Rayo, the team’s link to outside partners, was meticulous in refining every detail and balancing outreach with proofreading. Her strong communication skills and attention to detail made a big difference. Trixie Ann Alipoza took on the essential role of data gathering, working diligently to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of information. Tyrelle Eissenhuey Sunga focused on programming, turning ideas into a working, user-friendly platform. Vangelyn Panganiban kept everyone on track with her coordination skills, helping each member stay aligned and focused. Abbygael Pamintuan was the steady, reliable force in the group, always ready to take on tasks and push through challenges, no matter how tough they seemed. Together, they formed a dedicated and well-rounded team.
                <br><br>
                Together, they crafted IncluCity with the understanding that, though they came from different backgrounds and had unique personalities, they shared a common goal. They spent long nights coding, gathering data, and refining every feature, driven by the hope that their project would make life just a little easier for the PWD community of Malolos. The journey was far from easy, but it was one of growth, friendship, and shared dreams. Despite the obstacles, the team carried on, knowing they were building something meaningful—not just to fulfill academic requirements, but to leave a lasting legacy of compassion and inclusivity in their community.
